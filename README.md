## Description
This is the site I have been hired by Horiseon to update. I have taken their pre-existing code in order to re-factor and work upon the accessibility for improvements torwards browser data.
I have worked over the original HTML code, replacing generic elements with the proper semantic elements, while also making ammendments to the CSS code in order to reflect the HTML changes as
well as consolidating code in order to free up space/making things more crisp. This is the final product.

(The started code comes from the course curriculum)
